    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Master‚Äôs student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a GPA of 3.86/4.0 and an expected graduation date of September 2025. My thesis and research focus on Physical Design, particularly the RTL-to-GDSII flow, including synthesis, floorplanning, place-and-route (PnR), clock tree synthesis (CTS), and static timing analysis (STA). I am proficient in industry-standard EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys, and I have extensive experience in automating design flows using Tcl scripting.

    <h2>Key Projects</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Security-Aware PnR for Split-Manufactured ICs</h3>
      <p>
        As a Graduate Research Assistant at the UMass VLSI CAD Lab, I contributed to the development of a novel security-aware place-and-route (PnR) methodology that optimizes cell placement in k-secure designs. This approach achieved 12.55% lower power consumption, 41.16% higher operating frequency, and a 16.49% reduction in wirelength across benchmark circuits compared to non-security-aware placement techniques.
      </p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="card">
      <h3>ASIC Design and Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        Designed transistor-level schematics and layouts in Cadence Virtuoso, ran DRC/LVS using Assura, extracted parasitics, and simulated using HSPICE. Automated the full RTL-to-GDSII flow via TCL scripting including synthesis, PnR, power grid design, CTS, and STA.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>PPSFP Fault Simulation & BIST Design</h3>
      <p>
         Implemented a PPSFP fault simulator and a BIST framework using a 32-bit LFSR-based TPG and a 16-bit MISR-based output response analyzer. Achieved 95% fault coverage with 0.0015% aliasing probability across ISCAS benchmark circuits.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>MIPS32 Pipeline Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        Implemented a MIPS32 pipeline in Verilog for R-type and I-type instructions, with 14 ALU operations, HALT instruction support, and a specialized flip-flop for handling branch-taken scenarios effectively. Created a comprehensive testbench to verify functionalities and ensure proper operation of the pipeline.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>ALU Design & Optimization </h3>
      <p>
         Designed a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using multiplexers and full adders, performed synthesis (Synopsys DC Shell) and Place and Route (Cadence Innovus), and implemented a scan chain for testability. Evaluated various adder architectures and applied High-Level Synthesis (HLS) techniques to optimize performance, power, and area (PPA), while analyzing trade-offs to improve design efficiency and scalability.
